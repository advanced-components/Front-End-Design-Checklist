> The overarching goal of preparation is risk reduction: a good project planner clears major risks out of the way as early as possible so that the bulk of the project can proceed as smoothly as possible. By far the most common project risks in software development are poor requirements and poor project planning, thus preparation tends to focus on improving requirements and project plans.

> Building a software system is like any other project that takes people and money. If you’re building a house, you make architectural drawings and blueprints before you begin pounding nails. You’ll have the blueprints reviewed and approved before you pour any concrete. Having a technical plan counts just as much in software.

> You don’t start decorating the Christmas tree until you’ve put it in the stand. You don’t start a fire until you’ve opened the flue. You don’t go on a long trip with an empty tank of gas. You don’t get dressed before you take a shower, and you don’t put your shoes on before your socks. You have to do things in the right order in software, too.
Programmers are at the end of the software food chain. The architect consumes the requirements; the designer consumes the architecture; and the coder consumes the design.
